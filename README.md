<p align="center">Create your CV using only Markdown + (S)CSS</p>


## Idea

I was tired of updating my LaTeX CV for every job posting I wanted to send it.
Even though LaTeX is great, it is more suited for academic writing. Creating
complicated templates for something like a CV is tiring.

Nowadays, web technologies are much more suited for this task. HTML + CSS are
very easy to use and extremely powerful for designing.

This project aims to make everything even easier by using
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to fill in a set of different sections
into a CV by just filling in Markdown and specyfing the style with SCSS.

You can check out the results in [my CV](https://cvgen.meneillos.com).


## ðŸš€ Using it yourself

The final aim of this application is to help in the writing of the CV, and then
generating a PDF from it by printing the result into a PDF from the browser.

You can either serve a web or use it locally to get your PDFs.

To host it locally, you only need to install GatsbyJS and run it:

```bash
sudo npm i -g gatsby
npm i
gatsby develop
```

You will be able to see a live version of the CV that updates as you edit it by
pointing your browser to http://localhost:8000.

Keep in mind, if you want to host it somewhere and it is not in the domain root,
you will have to edit the `pathPrefix` variable of
[`./gatsby-config.js`](gatsby-config.js) with the path.


## Structure

You only need to create markdown files in the [`./src/content`](src/content/)
directory, which will get picked up by the compiler.

The different sections are:

```
cvgen
â”œâ”€â”€ Cover Letter
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ header.md               <- Header, shared between Cover Letter and CV
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ cover-letter.md         <- Cover Letter body
â””â”€â”€ CV
    â”œâ”€â”€ header.md               <- Header, shared between Cover Letter and CV
    â”œâ”€â”€ profile.md              <- Personal profile short text
    â”œâ”€â”€ experience.*.md         <- Job experience, one job per file
    â”œâ”€â”€ education.*.md          <- Degrees and courses, one per file
    â”œâ”€â”€ languages.md            <- Spoken languages list
    â”œâ”€â”€ skills-tech.md          <- Technical skills list
    â”œâ”€â”€ skills-pers.md          <- Soft skills list
    â”œâ”€â”€ publications.md         <- Publications and talks
    â”œâ”€â”€ extracurricular.*.md    <- Extracurricular activities, one per file
    â”œâ”€â”€ training.md             <- Training
    â””â”€â”€ interests.md            <- Hobbies and personal interests
```

You can reorder this sections by editing the components inside `<Page>` in the
file [`./src/pages/index.js`](src/pages/index.js).


## Style

Styling is done by editing the SCSS files at `.src/styles`. You are on your own
on this (for now).


## To-do

* Generate a PDF from the command line.
* Add different styles.
