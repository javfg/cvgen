While getting my degree, I worked part-time in a small software company. I focused mainly on web development and systems administration.

* Set up a self-hosted mail service based on **Postfix/Dovecot** to replace the previous externally hosted one, reducing costs dramatically.
* Maintained networks, service infrastructures and database processes for multiple clients **ensuring uninterrupted operation**.
* Designed and maintained web portals and applications with **high availability**.
* Provided client support via email, phone and in-situ visits.
