Before I left Spain, I worked in a small software company which specializes in smart devices and big data.

* Designed and developed multi-platform applications (web, mobile, native) using **Flask** (Python 3) and **Node.js** (JavaScript) backends; and **React** frontends along with the **Electron** framework.
* Requirement capture and analysis and data modeling.
* Liaised with clients to engage them in the development progress and ensured there was no drift from the desired final product.
* Developed a machine learning based Bluetooth indoor positioning system with Python, using **PyTorch/Pandas**.
* Collaborated with an external company in the implementation of a Natural Language Processing engine for search query intent using the **Apache Big Data toolset**.
