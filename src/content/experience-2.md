My journey at CERN started as a Full Stack Engineer at the **Collaboration, Devices and Applications group**, which encompassed device management, general applications (like printer support), web publishing, digital repositories and, finally, collaborative software like **Indico**, where I worked.

I became part of their small six-people team inside the **Integrated Collaboration section** during the last part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the situation, I was warmly welcomed by them and managed to get up to speed very fast. I made significant contributions extending the backend with new features and modernizing the frontend.

* Participated in the final phase of migrating the code from Python 2 to **Python 3**, always using the latest version (3.9 to 3.11).
* Built a prototype for the **integration of CERNBox into Indico**. It enables users to pick files from their CERNBox storage space (or any other OwnCloud-based services) to add as materials in a conference or meeting. Designed and implemented from scratch, this involved commissioning servers, writing Puppet configuration manifests, establishing Production and QA environments, performing security analysis and following best practices, and writing documentation for the API.
* Added the **Unlisted Events** feature to Indico, from design and UI mockups to implementation and testing.
* Refactored extensive parts of the user interface into **React** from JQuery and AngularJS, modernizing the look and feel and dropping legacy parts of the codebase.
* Improved the authentication system by adding a **local cache for user credentials**, for which I wrote a **heavy suite of tests** to ensure its robustness.
* Extended Indico's database schema (**PostgreSQL**) to accommodate new features.
* Used **advanced Python techniques** such as metaclasses for plugin interfaces, and packaging using setuptools for application distribution.
* Contributed to **[Newdle](https://newdle.cern.ch)**: a privacy‑friendly alternative to Doodle that is hosted at CERN. It is a React Single-Page-Application with a Python 3 backend.
* Helped in the planning and execution of upgrades, deployments and service maintenance operations to run Indico in a smooth way with **zero or minimal downtime**.
* Provided end-user support for the global Indico community (forum, chat, email) and the CERN community (chat, emails, tickets, phone & videoconference training).
