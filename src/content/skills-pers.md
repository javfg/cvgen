  - title: Curious
    content: My main driving force is to understand how things work on the inside and learning new skills to achieve that. Because of this, I enjoy reading about new technologies and testing new techniques, not only for work but also for my own personal growth.
  - title: Flexible

  - title: Organized
    content: I like to keep my space and my time clutter free. Planning tasks thoroughly saves time in the long run as you reduce iteration.
  - title: Eager to help
    content: I think everyone works better when they know all the details about the task at hand. When colleagues turn to me with questions or problems, I try to be as helpful as possible. If you want to master something, teach it.
