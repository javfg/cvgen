Before working at CERN, I lived in Cambridge for two years while working in [EMBL](https://embl.org), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. EMBL is an intergovernmental organization similar to CERN, with sites in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The one I worked at, [EMBL-EBI](https://ebi.ac.uk), is the European Bioinformatics Institute, which focuses on big data software services for life sciences.

* Created the cloud‑based rework of **[identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org)**, a location-independent resolving system for life sciences IDs, which aims to help scientists adhere to **[FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)**. The system consists of a **Java Spring Framework** backend and a **React Single-Page-Application** deployed on **Google Cloud** with **Kubernetes**. The whole rework was done by a very small team composed of two developers and a project manager.
* Contributed to the **[Human Cell Atlas Project](https://www.humancellatlas.org/)** Data Ingest Service. I created a submission validation suite using **Python 3** and **Neo4J**, a graph database.
* Worked on the frontend for the second version of the **[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)**, a public-private partnership-driven application that uses human genetics and genomics data for systematic drug target identification and prioritization. I was heavily involved in data visualization and tabular representation.
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed and developed the **[Open Targets COVID‑19 Target Prioritization Tool](https://blog.opentargets.org/covid-19-target-prioritisation-tool-released/)**, a fully client‑side application which aggregated all the viral target data known at that moment. The tool leveraged the **IndexedDB browser API** to handle all the database workload without a backend.
