I worked for two years in [EMBL-EBI](https://ebi.ac.uk), the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute, which focuses on big
data software services for life sciences.

* Front-end architecture design and implementation for the second version of the
  **[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)**. This is a
  modern **React SPA** leveraging a **GraphQL API** and visualizations using
  **D3.js**.
* Modern cloud remake of **[identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org)** into a
  distributed microservice architecture hosted on **GCP** with **Kubernetes**.
  It was built using **Spring Framework** and **React**.
* Design and implementation of a submission validation suite for the **[Human
  Cell Atlas Project](https://www.humancellatlas.org/)** Data Ingest Service,
  using **Python 3** and **Neo4J**, a graph database.
* During the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed and developed the **[Open Targets
  COVID‑19 Target Prioritization
  Tool](https://blog.opentargets.org/covid-19-target-prioritisation-tool-released/)**
  from scratch. It was a fully client‑side application which aggregated all the
  viral target data known at that moment.
