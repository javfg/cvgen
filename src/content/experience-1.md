I am currently working in the **Storage and Data management group**. We are in charge of the data services for physics, the tape and backup service, and the CEPH, EOS and CERNBox services. **CERNBox** is what I work on most of my time. It is the cloud data storage and collaborative hub for all of the CERN community. It provides 18PB storage for about 37k people at CERN.

During this year in the **General Storage Services section**, I have familiarized myself with the whole ecosystem, learning GoLang and VueJS and making significant contributions in different areas of the platform. We follow a SCRUM-like agile approach, enabling the 15 team members to contribute to a highly complex and distributed platform.

* Participated in **finalizing the web** for the new CERNBox release by solving bugs and implementing changes from **user feedback**.
* Set up and maintain **auto-contained and instantiable dev environments** for the entire CERNBox stack with hot‑reloading and enhanced quality of life for the developers.
* Contributed to the **Puppet infrastructure** configuration and to the GitHub Actions deployment pipeline.
* Integrated CERNBox with multiple collaborative web applications (CodiMD, Indico), using the **File-Picker service** I prototyped while working in Indico.
* Worked on improving, testing and expanding **WOPI** (Web Application Open Platform Interface Protocol): a Python application which bridges CERNBox with different Web apps like Office 365, CodiMD and DrawIO.
* Designed and implemented a **notification system** for the new CERNBox interface. It enables users to notify their peers about actions performed on any file or folder via different media (like e-mail or web notifications); and developers to easily extend the system with new notifications.
* Extended **REVA**, the CERNBox backend, with **[NATS](https://nats.io)**, a next‑generation message passing system to communicate the different services of the distributed platform more efficiently.
* Designed the **MySQL database schema** for the notification system.
* Finished the **REVA CephFS driver** to ensure it supports web and the desktop sync client, and integrated it with current operational infrastructure.
* Reviewed the legacy DFSBrowser.aspx application user experience and **implemented feature parity** into CERNBox, in particular **tooling for 2nd line support staff** in order to ensure a smooth service transition.
* Provided end‑user support (email, chat, tickets, phone) for the CERNBox and EOS platforms.
