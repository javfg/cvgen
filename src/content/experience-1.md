I have been working at CERN since the start of 2021. My time has been divided
into two separate projects: [Indico](https://getindico.io/), an event
organization tool; and the
[EOS](https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/)/[CERNBox](https://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/)
enterprise file sync&share platform, which is used by more than 37,000 people
and handles 18PB of data. During this time, I have adapted myself to the
work practices of both teams and made significant contributions, taking
ownership of new features and services.

* Design, implementation, deployment and maintenance of major features and new
  services. The development stacks involve **Python**, **GoLang** and
  **JavaScript** with **React** and **Vue**.
* **Evaluation of feature requests** for Indico and CERNBox, interviewing with
  users for requirement acquisition; considering security aspects and additional
  constraints such as GDPR.
* **Operation and monitoring** of the EOS/CERNBox and Indico systems. Using
  tools like Puppet, OpenStack and Grafana. Plan maintenance operations to run
  the services with minimal downtime.
* Speaker at multiple **conferences and workshops**, in relation with European
  H2020 grants.
* **Selection, supervision and mentoring** of new colleagues, fellows and summer
  students.
* **End-user support** for the worldwide Indico community (200+ instances), and
  the EOS/CERNBox user base.
