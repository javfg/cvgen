Dear Hiring Manager,

The purpose of this letter is to express my interest in the Software Engineer role at the TE-MPE-CB section, currently being offered. It came to my attention through the CERN jobs website, and I was immediately drawn to the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your team.

I am a Software Engineer with five years' full-time experience, and many more of part-time experience gained while pursuing my degree in Computer Science. I have felt a passion for computing and electronics since I started playing with my Commodore 64 at a very young age. Staying on top of the new developments and learning how to get stuff done with different technologies is my day to day; not only in my job but also as a hobby. Throughout my career, I have held multiple positions where I designed and implemented large software systems. I also performed day to day operations and systems administration, easily adapting to the needs of my team. I think these traits align very well with the requirements of the job position being offered.

Another crucial aspect in my decision to apply was how closely my beliefs corresponded with the CERN core values. I have always been convinced knowledge should be free and universally available. Universities and Public Institutions should empower research and the advancement of science, always through public and open means. This is why organizations like [EMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)—where I worked before—and CERN, are fulfilling a very important role in providing a substrate for science to grow and be maintained. And I want to contribute to this goal. Having worked in the IT department of CERN for more than two years has been a truly fulfilling experience, but given my love for electronics and hardware devices, I am now hoping I can find a position in a place closer to the machines which make CERN unique in the world.

I believe that my blend of technical skills, industry experience, and passion for computing and electronics makes me an ideal candidate for the position. My training and work experience during the last years perfectly fits the job's description. Furthermore, my enthusiasm for new technologies, combined with my ability to learn quickly, means that I will be able to hit the ground running and make valuable contributions to the team in a short timespan.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and to learn more about the role.

Sincerely,\
**Javier Ferrer**
