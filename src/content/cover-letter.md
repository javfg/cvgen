Dear Hiring Manager,

This is an open cover letter for my public Curriculum Vitae. I am a full stack
engineer currently working as a fellow at CERN's IT department. I have a broad
experience in different International Scientific Organizations, where I
contributed to many open science and open source projects.

My skill set encompasses both development and operations, and I have a wide
knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies. Throughout my career, I
have designed highly scalable distributed systems; and accessible, performant
and aesthetically pleasing web applications. Some of them are showcased in my
GitHub profile, as well as my resume.

I have a keen interest in computing, which extends to my personal life as a
hobbyist hardware maker. I designed and built small devices like hardware
monitors and keyboards; and enjoy building computers and home servers that meet
strict space, temperature and performance specifications.

Whether this open letter has been found in my [public
CV](https://cvgen.meneillos.com/public/) or it has reached you, please consider
it an invitation to contact me regarding any position which might be suitable
for my abilities and experience. I am open to jobs which allow me to expand my
knowledge while contributing to a worthwhile goal, and align with my values on
upholding openness and equality.

If you are looking for someone who puts passion in their craft and your ideals
resonate with mine, please contact me.

Sincerely,\
**Javier Ferrer**
