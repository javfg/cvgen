Murcia Lan Party is a yearly event for hackers, gamers, and computing enthusiasts. It is a local event which attracts people from all over the country. Usually it involves 1024 participants during 4 to 6 days. I was one of the organizers and worked on the network set-up and administration from its beginnings and until I left Spain.
